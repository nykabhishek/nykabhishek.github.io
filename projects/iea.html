            <b>Abstract:</b>
            IEA is a new paradigm in Autonomous Vehicle technology that looks at offloading the core computational
            capabilities of awareness generation and path planning from the vehicle out onto Smart Roadside Units
            equipped with various sensors. Through this distributed setup IEA provides a solution to shared liabilities
            by transferring the primary responsibility of localization from vehicle to infrastructure which in turn
            enables greater situational awareness of the area under the purview of IEA. IEA architecture is deployed on
            specific sections of roads or special traffic corridors by installing Road-Side Units (RSU) on either side
            of the road. These RSUs are fitted with multi-sensor smart packs (MSSP) containing sensors required for
            localizing vehicles. These MSSPs monitor the vehicles in the section of the roads under the purview of IEA
            and aid in generating situational awareness which can be transmitted to the vehicles subscribing to this
            information.
            <br>
            <br>
            MSSP includes several sensors that carry-out specific individual tasks and aid in generating the
            localization information. For example, cameras installed on the RSUs as a part of the MSSP are used to
            monitor traffic by identifying and locating all the objects of interest in the traffic corridor. MSSPs are
            installed with special SmartConnect devices, whose function is to establish wireless connectivity between
            MSSPs and the vehicles subscribing to its information, thus enabling the transmission of information
            necessary for its localization. The SmartConnect devices are communication medium agnostic and modular so
            that they can be easily substituted by newer technologies.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this project, I set up the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Infrastructure-to-Infrastructure (I2I)
            communication networks using DSRC and developed the software stacks on smart infrastructures for vehicle
            state estimation, localization, and computer vision tasks like object detection, tracking, and semantic
            segmentation. Further, I calibrated the cameras and sensor systems using OpenCV and developed SLAM
            capabilities for RSUs by fusing IMU, camera, GPS/RTK, and odometry data using estimation filters (like
            Monte-Carlo and Extended Kalman Filters (EKF)) for autonomous navigation of a Lincoln MKZ vehicle.
