I have been working as a student researcher under the guidance of Dr. Sivakumar Rathinam and Dr. Swaminathan Gopalswamy being part of the CAST group at Texas A&M University since Fall 2017. The goals of my research are to enable "perception" in autonomous vehicles and smart infrastructures. My research interests include the use of image processing, machine learning, neural networks and similar techniques to deploy machine-vision and develop vision-based control algorithms. As a part of the Connected Autonomous Safe Transportation (CAST) team working on Infrastructure enabled Autonomy (IEA), I developed machine vision capabilities for smart infrastructures which enable them to detect cars, pedestrians, and other objects-of-interest, and to localize each object with respect to the environment. After localizing all the objects-of-interest with its surroundings, a situational awareness map is generated to control the car to safely maneuver the desired path. For the project "Response of autonomous vehicle to Emergency response vehicles", I developed vision-based algorithms for classifying vehicles into emergency response vehicles (EV) and normal vehicles (non-EV) using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Once an emergency vehicle is identified, its motion sequence is tracked for the duration of the video feed. The EV localization information is provided as a control input to safely maneuver the autonomous vehicle to a stop. Iâ€™m currently working on the project "Reference Machine vision for ADAS Functions", which aims at developing a reference Lane Detection (LD) system. The LD system will provide a benchmark for evaluating different lane markings and perception algorithms. We aim to create a system that validates the effectiveness of lane markings as well as the vision algorithms through systematic development of LD metrics.
