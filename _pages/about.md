Hi I'm Abhishek Nayak. I'm a doctoral student in the department of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University, College Station. My current research deals with enabling "perception" in autonomous vehicles, smart infrastructures and deploying vision based control. I'm passionate about Automobiles and road safety, and am working towards improving the safety standards on the street!

Research Interests:
  * computer vision
  * autonomous vehicles
  * algorithms
  * multi-agent path planning
  * machine learning

I have been working under the guidance of [Dr. Sivakumar Rathinam](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/rathinam-sivakumar.html) as a part of the [Autonomous Systems Laboratory](https://autonomy.engr.tamu.edu/ "Autonomous Systems Laboratory") and [Dr. Swaminathan Gopalswamy](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/gopalswamy-s.html) as a part of the [CAST group](https://cast.tamu.edu/ "CAST (Connected Autonomous Safe Transportation)") at Texas A&M University since Fall 2017.


In 2019, I received my Masters degree and my thesis was on developing vision-based response of autonomous vehicles towards emergency vehicles using infrastructure enabled autonomy. Prior to joining Texas A&M, I was working as a Design Engineer at the R&D of [TVS Motor Company, India](https://www.tvsmotor.com/), where I was responsible for designing and developing the cylinderhead had and valve train parts.

My undergraduate degree was in Mechanical Engineering from the [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/), from which I graduated in 2014. During my undergraduate program, I worked on developing a device to improve cornering stability of a powered two wheeler vehicle.
