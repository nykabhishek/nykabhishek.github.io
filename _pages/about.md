I am a doctoral student in the department of mechanical engineering at Texas A&M University, College Station. My main research deals with enabling "perception" in autonomous vehicles, smart infrastructures and deploying vision based control. My research interests revolve around autonomous ground vehicles, computer vision and machine learning. I have been working under the guidance of [Dr. Sivakumar Rathinam](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/rathinam-sivakumar.html) as a part of the [Autonomous Systems Laboratory](https://autonomy.engr.tamu.edu/ "Autonomous Systems Laboratory") and [Dr. Swaminathan Gopalswamy](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/gopalswamy-s.html) as a part of the [CAST group](https://cast.tamu.edu/ "CAST (Connected Autonomous Safe Transportation)") at Texas A&M University since Fall 2017.


In 2019, I received my Masters degree and thesis work was on developing vision-based response of autonomous vehicles towards emergency vehicles using infrastructure enabled autonomy. Prior to joining Texas A&M, I was working as a Design Engineer at the R&D of [TVS Motor Company, India](https://www.tvsmotor.com/), where I was responsible for designing and developing the cylinderhead had and valve train parts.

My undergraduate degree was in Mechanical Engineering from the [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/), from which I graduated in 2014. During my undergraduate program, I worked on developing a device to improve cornering stability of a powered two wheeler vehicle.
