Hi!
I'm a doctoral student in Mechanical engineering at Texas A&M University. I have been working under the guidance of Dr. Sivakumar Rathinam and Dr. Swaminathan Gopalswamy as a part of the CAST group at Texas A&M University since Fall 2017. My main research objectives include enabling "perception" in autonomous vehicles and smart infrastructures. My research interests include the use of image processing, machine learning, neural networks and similar techniques to deploy machine-vision and develop vision-based control algorithms.
