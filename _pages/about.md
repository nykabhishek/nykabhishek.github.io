Hi I'm Abhishek Nayak. I'm a doctoral student in the department of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University, College Station. My current research deals with enabling "perception" in autonomous vehicles, smart infrastructures and deploying vision based control. I'm passionate about Automobiles and road safety, and am working towards improving the safety standards on the street!

Since Fall 2017, I have been part of the [Autonomous Systems Laboratory](https://autonomy.engr.tamu.edu/ "Autonomous Systems Laboratory") and [CAST group](https://cast.tamu.edu/ "CAST (Connected Autonomous Safe Transportation)") at Texas A&M University, working under [Dr. Sivakumar Rathinam](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/rathinam-sivakumar.html) and [Dr. Swaminathan Gopalswamy](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/gopalswamy-s.html).


I received my Master of Science degree in Dec 2019 and my thesis work was on developing vision-based response of autonomous vehicles towards emergency vehicles using infrastructure enabled autonomy. More details of this project can be found in the [Projects](https://nykabhishek.github.io/projects/ "Projects") section. Prior to joining Texas A&M, I was working as a Design Engineer at the R&D of [TVS Motor Company, India](https://www.tvsmotor.com/), where I was responsible for designing and developing the cylinderhead had and valve train parts.

**Research Interests:** Computer vision, Autonomous vehicles, Algorithms, Multi-agent path planning, Machine learning

<!-- My undergraduate degree was in Mechanical Engineering from the [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/), from which I graduated in 2014. During my undergraduate program, I worked on developing a device to improve cornering stability of a powered two wheeler vehicle.
