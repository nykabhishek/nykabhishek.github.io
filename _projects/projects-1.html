title: "Reference Machine Vision for ADAS functions"
location: "TTI"
excerpt: "The objective of this project is to develop a reference Lane Detection (LD) system that will provide a benchmark for evaluating different lane markings, sensors and perception algorithms. An extensive video dataset was collected by driving on various roads in Central Texas comprising of different weather conditions, time of day, pavement marking presence and luminance variables. The videos were evaluated on different state-of-the art LD algorithms and their performance was ranked based on a set of metrics specifically developed for evaluating the LD effectiveness. <br/><img src='/images/lane.jpg'>"

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Studies have shown that fatalities due to unintentional roadway departures can be significantly reduced if Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Lane Keep Assist (LKA) systems are used effectively. 
    However, these systems are not yet popular because the systems are not robust due, in part to the lack of suitable standards for pavement markings that enable reliable functionality of the sensor system. 
    The objective of this project is to develop a reference Lane Detection (LD) system that will provide a benchmark for evaluating different lane markings, sensors, and perception algorithms. 
    The goal of the project is to create a system that will validate the effectiveness of lane markings as well as the vision algorithms through a systematic development of LD metrics, and testing procedures for LD algorithms.
