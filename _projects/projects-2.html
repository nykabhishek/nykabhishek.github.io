title: "Response of Autonomous Vehicles to Emergency Response Vehicles (RAVEV)"
excerpt: "The objective of this project was to explore how an autonomous vehicle must safely respond to different classes of emergency vehicles using sound, vision and other onboard sensors. I developed vision-based emergency vehicle detection, tracking and localization capabilities for the smart road-side infrastructure using Python and ROS. YOLO-v3 was used as the base architecture for object detection, and a TensorFlow-based object classification neural network was developed using Keras. <br/><img src='/images/ravev.png'>"

    The objective of this project is to explore an ideal response action of an autonomous vehicle towards response vehicles in emergency scenarios using vision, sound and other sensors. 
    I developed vision-based algorithms to reliably detect and track emergency vehicles from a video feed using image processing, machine learning, deep neural networks and other computer vison techniques. 
     
    The developments on this work is being published as a conference paper in SAE WCX 2019.
