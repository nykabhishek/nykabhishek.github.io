title: "Response of Autonomous Vehicles to Emergency Response Vehicles (RAVEV)"
excerpt: "The objective of this project is to explore an ideal response action of an autonomous vehicle towards response vehicles in emergency scenarios using vision, sound and other sensors. I developed vision-based algorithms to reliably detect and track emergency vehicles from a video feed using image processing, machine learning, deep neural networks and other computer vison techniques. A Safe-D UTC sponsored project (https://rip.trb.org/view/1500797). The developments on this work is being published as a conference paper in SAE WCX 2019.<br/><img src='/images/ravev.png'>"
