# excerpt: 'This article presents an approximation algorithm for a task allocation, sequencing and scheduling problem involving a team of human operators and robots. Specifically, we present an algorithm with an approximation ratio as a function of the number of human operators ($ m $) and the number of robots ($ k $) in the team. The approximation ratios are $\frac {7}{2}-\frac {5}{4k} $, $\frac {5}{2}-\frac {1}{k} $ and $\frac {7}{2}-\frac {1}{k} $ when $ m= 1$, $ m\geq k\geq 2$ and $ k> m\geq 2$ respectively.'

This article presents an approximation algorithm for a task allocation, sequencing and scheduling problem involving a team of human operators and robots. Specifically, we present an algorithm with an approximation ratio as a function of the number of human operators ($ m $) and the number of robots ($ k $) in the team. The approximation ratios are $\frac {7}{2}-\frac {5}{4k} $, $\frac {5}{2}-\frac {1}{k} $ and $\frac {7}{2}-\frac {1}{k} $ when $ m= 1$, $ m\geq k\geq 2$ and $ k> m\geq 2$ respectively.
